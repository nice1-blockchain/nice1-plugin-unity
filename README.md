# About NICE1 

NICE1 is a blockchain project, which aims to decentralize the video games industries. We offer a new NFT feature, that provides a valuable system of video games sales.

The goal of NICE1 is to offer multi-services to all worldwide developers, related to the blockchain system of NFT, based on EOS platform. We are looking for a fair and revolutionary video game industry, where the player is the main character, owning every content that he buys or gets from the game, skipping main industries and bigger companies platform barriers. The player must be the realowner of his game content!
